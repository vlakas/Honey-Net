### iktomi

Iktomi is a small tool melded together through Perl & Bash that acts as a Honey Pot simulator.

It basically opens well known ports, accepts/closes connections and records which addresses visited said ports.

This has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Server and the pre requisits are as follows:

* Linux
* Perl (Most modern version should do)
* Bash
* Ps (Process Tool)

These dependancies come bundleded with most distros.
