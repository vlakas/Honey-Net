#vsFTPd 2.3.4

This docker container is created by downloading an approved vulnerable vsFTPd 2.3.4 version from https://www.exploit-db.com/

The provided Dockerfile manually installs, checks, optimizes and serves the vulnerable application.

If you notice, this is done on the latest debian image with certain types of protection enabled, so breaking in to the application is not straight forward.

The thing is it is not meant to be brkoen in to, but it should be used as a bait to irritate attackers in order to try multiple attack vectors and be recorded.
